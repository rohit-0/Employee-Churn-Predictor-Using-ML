# Employee Churn Predictor Using Machine Learning

#### Employee Churn or Attrition is the overall turnover in an organization's staff as existing employees leave and new ones are hired. It can be abrupt, sudden and sometimes highly drastic.

Employee Churn has a number of disadvantages to the company like:

* Decreased Overall Performance.
* Difficulty in managing daily tasks .
* Increased Costs of paying previous employees and hiring new ones.
* Loss of experienced employees.
* High attrition rate has negative impact on company image.
* Time and money wasted on trained employees who leave.

In this project, I have taken the HR dataset from kaggle. 
The file has information about the employees of a company. The data is about:
1. satisfaction_level: It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.
2. last_evaluation: It is evaluated performance by the employer, which also ranges from 0-1.
3. number_projects: How many numbers of projects assigned to an employee?
4. average_monthly_hours: How many average numbers of hours worked by an employee in a month?
5. time_spent_company: time_spent_company means employee experience. The number of years spent by an employee in the company.
6. work_accident: Whether an employee has had a work accident or not.
7. promotion_last_5years: Whether an employee has had a promotion in the last 5 years or not.
8. Departments: Employee's working department/division.
9. Salary: Salary level of the employee such as low, medium and high.
10. left: Whether the employee has left the company or not.
